moonlight Far away my well-lit door Mr. Beerbelly <br>
Beerbelly Get these mutts away from me You know I<br>
don't find this stuff amusing anymore If you'll <br>
be my bodyguard I can be your long lost pal <br>
I can call you Betty And Betty when you <br>

down the street He says why am I short <br>
of attentionGot a short little span of <br>
attentionAnd wo my nights are so long <br>
Where's my wife and family What if I <br>
die here Who'll be my role-model Now <br>
that my role-model is Gone Gone He <br>
ducked back down the alley With <br>
some roly-poly little bat-faced <br>
girl All along along There were <br>
incidents and accidentsThere <br>
were hints and allegations<br>
If you'll be my bodyguard<br>

languageHe holds no <br>
currency He is a<br>
foreign man He <br>
is surrounded <br>
by the sound The <br>
sound Cattle in <br>
the marketplace<br>
Scatterlings and<br>
orphanages He <br>
looks around, <br>
around He <br>
sees angels <br>
in the <br>
architecture<br> 
Spinning in <br>
infinity<br>
He says <br>
