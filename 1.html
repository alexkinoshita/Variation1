A man walks down the street
He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
<p>
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff <br> amusing anymore
</p>

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
<br>
A man walks down the street
He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
<p>
Who'll be my role-model
Now that my role-model is
Gone Gone
</p>
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
<p>
</p>
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations
<p>
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
</p>
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
<br>
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
</br>
He is a foreign man
<p>
He is surrounded by the sound
The sound
<br>
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
<
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen! and Hallelujah!
</p>

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
<p>
Call me Al
</p>
