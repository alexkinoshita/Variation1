A man walks down the street He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoonIn a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger BonediggerDogs in the moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts 
away from me
You know
</p>
<br>

I don't
find this
stuff amusing anymore
If you'll be my bodyguard I can be 
your long lost pal I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me You can call me Al
A man walks down the street He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attentionAnd wo my nights are so 

<br>

long Where's my wife and family What if I die here 
Who'll be my role-model Now that my role-model is
Gone Gone He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced 
girl All along along There were 
incidents and accidents
There were 


<p>

hints and 
allegations
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal I can 


call you Betty And Betty when 
you call me You can call 
me Al Call me Al
A man walks 
down 
</p>

the street
It's a street in 
a strange world Maybe it's 
the Third World Maybe it's his
first time aroundHe doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency He is a foreign man He is surrounded 
by the sound The sound Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages


He looks around, around
He sees angels 
in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen! and 

<br>
Hallelujah!
<br>

<p>
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost 
palI can call you Betty
And Betty when 
you call me
You can call 
me Al
</p>
Call 
me 
Al
