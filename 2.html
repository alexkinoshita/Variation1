A man walks down the street


<br>


He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
<p>
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
</p>


<br>


Bonedigger Bonedigger
<p> Dogs in the moonlight </p>
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore
<br>
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
<p>
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
</p>

A man walks down the street
He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
<p>
Who'll be my role-model
Now that my role-model is
Gone Gone
</p>
<p>
</p>
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations
<br>
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty

<p>

And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al

</p>

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound

<p>
The sound
</p>

Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen! and Hallelujah!

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
<p>
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al
</p>
